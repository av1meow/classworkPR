        <h1 class=titleS>Peleshno in The Acid Rain</h1>
          <p class="story"><span class="highlight">I live in a little town called Peleshno. Its very polluted smells like chickens, its constainly scorching unbearable hot outside. One day I woke up and thought it was really early in the morning seeing how the daylight had slight abnormal haze then usual outside. I was on my way to walk to the bus stop when I noticed it was not foggy or gloomy cause of rain but there was specks of random coming from the sky, when I looked harder to find out what was coming out of the sky it was ashes, Burning Ashes.</span></p>
            <b class="b">(side note there is an amzing movie whitch is base off a video game called Silent Hill where there is a town that is always on fire and raining ashes. the ash falling in pealeshno reminded me so much of that movie was so beautiful)</b>
            <p class="story"><span class="highlight">I got so excited that is was raining ashes I turned up my tape player fast forrward to my favorite song and started dancing. I was dancing so hard and with with so much heart and spirt it started to rain. With the rain and the ash falling, me dancing even harder the rain began to slowly start burning people, It became acid rain. As the slow acid rain and ash came down my love for the pain and misary grew stronger and I kept dancing, the acid rain got heavy and more heated it started to diteriate the building of peleashno. People were screaming in agony and crying, big businesses were freaking out "I paid top peleashno dollars for this building why is it breaking apart so fast?" the Peleshno citizins were jumping out of top story building, alot runing trying to find anywhere to get out of the acid rain. As I was still at the bus stop listing to the beautiful sounds of nature I relized I too was starting to get burned by the acid rain, it had stiked me and went against me. I stopped dancing but the acid just keep pouring. There was this little wine factory called Sweedums and that factory was Peleshno's num.1 big company that produced more then 50% of its polution. The workers there seen there was a little patch of polution that wasnt getting hit to much by the acid rain so the workers ran over to there and started pumping more polution to try to make that patch bigger and maybe save the town. Workers were burning to death left and right the citizens of Peleshno were trying to get to Sweedums Wine Factory to help build the polution cloud. The polution cloud started to get bigger, harder to breath, and giving us nose bleeds and hacking up more black flem, but Sweedums did it, they saved peleashno. The polution from the Sweedums Wine Facrory was so thick, huge, and a major health hazord it was able to stop the acid rain from pouring on us. Buildings were deystroyed, bodys everywere, alive, dead, seriously injured, aboot to die, missing body parts, suver burns it was magnifacent. If I could, Yes I would dance and have the acid rain come back again, it was my most fantastic day ever.</span></p>
