      <p class="story2" style="border-style:solid;borderwidth:1px;">I am the number one Stalker Serial Killer in Plesheno. They call me The Collectable Wayne. I stared off as a local small town stalker back in 2001. My 1st client that I stalked needed someone to stalk for them, named me The Collectable Wayne. I use to have a partner name Doc.Stalk some people can get careless well stalking its no a easy job. As years went by I stopped stalking lost intrest, started focusing on school. 2005 came I started stalking again but this time it didnt feel the same I needed more and more of a rush. I found this one victim that I use to slightly stalk on the side for fun, well it sure did become fun that was how I became the number one stalker serial killer in Peleshno. I once again hung up my outfits i had one where i stalked you and one were I had fun and made some artistic corpes... I went into retierment for now. No one in Pelesheno forgot aboot The Collectable Wayne.
